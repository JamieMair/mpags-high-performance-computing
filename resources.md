## GitHub Classroom

The assessment and submission will be done via GitHub Classroom, which allows for automated marking and feedback. The assignment for each week will be emailed to everyone enrolled in the class. You will need a GitHub account (it's free!) to sign up.

**Git/GitHub Refresher**

For this course, you do **not** need to be an expert with Git, but its use is encouraged. The video below gives an overview of Git for researchers, but any Git video/tutorial should be enough. Basic usage needed for the course will be covered during the first workshop.

## Computing Resources

During this course, you should be able to do everything on your own personal machine. I would advise trying to run some code on your local cluster as well if you have access. However, not everybody has access to a GPU, and specifically during part of the course, you will need access to a modern NVIDIA GPU. If you have access to your local institution's HPC already, but do not have GPU access, you can ask your local admin to give you a small number of GPU hours (around 20 should be more than enough).

Another option is to use Google Colab which has free access to GPU resources for testing. There is also a cheap paid option for better access. The [notebook linked here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/julia_notebooks/blob/master/Julia_Colab_Notebook_Template.ipynb) has instructions for how to setup Julia and CUDA. This is the easiest way to get started.

If you are from UoN and are struggling to access GPUs, contact [myself](mailto:jamie.mair@nottingham.ac.uk) to see if we can arrange temporary access to our in-house Physics cluster. Access to this cluster **cannot** be guaranteed, and we advise students to use this as a last resort.
