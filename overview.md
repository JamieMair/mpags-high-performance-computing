# High Performance Computing in Julia, from the ground up.

This module is designed for teaching programming to new Masters/PhD students, starting from the basics and working up to writing high performance code for any scale. This module will primarily be delivered via the Midlands Physics Alliance Graduate School ([MPAGS](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/mpags/modules/)). This is free for anyone else who is interested in the material to join as well, as the lecture notes will be available to everyone. Get in touch with the module convenor via [email](mailto:jamie.mair@nottingham.ac.uk) if you would like to enroll, and receive updates about the course.

Students taking this course are assumed to have at least limited experience with programming before. No knowledge about the Julia programming language is required. This course will focus on teaching a lot of the fundamentals of programming in the first few weeks and working up to High Performance Computing concepts such as parallel computing, GPU programming etc.

See the [Topics](/topics/) page for a detailed overview of the topics covered.
