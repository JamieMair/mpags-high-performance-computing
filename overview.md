# High Performance Computing in Julia, from the ground up.

This module is designed for teaching programming to new Masters/PhD students, starting from the basics and working up to writing high performance code for any scale. This module will primarily be delivered via the Midlands Physics Alliance Graduate School ([MPAGS](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/mpags/modules/)). The module is open to anyone else who is interested in the material. All of the resources (including the lecture notes) will be available publically. Get in touch with me via [email](mailto:jamie.mair@nottingham.ac.uk) if you would like to enroll, and receive updates about the course.

## Prerequisites

Students taking this course should match following description:
1. Have at least some limited experience with programming in **any** language, e.g. Python, MATLAB, C/C++ etc.


Students taking this course are assumed to have at least *limited experience* with programming before. No prior knowledge about the Julia programming language is required. This course will focus on teaching the fundamentals of scientific programming in the first few weeks and working up to High Performance Computing concepts such as parallel computing, GPU programming etc.

See the [Topics](/topics/) page for a detailed overview of the topics covered.

# Module Convenor

This course is taught by me, **Jamie Mair**, a final-year PhD student at the University of Nottingham studying Machine Learning in Physics. You can contact me about the course via via [email](mailto:jamie.mair@nottingham.ac.uk).

# Timetable and format

This course will run in the spring term (**January 2023**). The format of this course will be a 2-hour session each week consisting of a lecture and a workshop. The bulk of the reference material will be provided in the format of a book.

# Assessment

Each week of teaching will have a corresponding assessment delivered via GitHub classroom, with automatic marking.
